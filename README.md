#### **Bugs**

If the default example not added to your software isn't functioning how it should, please join the Discord server https://discord.gg/keyauth and submit the issue in the `#bugs` channel.

However, we do **NOT** provide support for adding KeyAuth to your project. If you can't figure this out you should use Google or YouTube to learn more about the programming language you want to sell a program in.

#### **Security practices**

* Utilize obfuscation provided by companies such as VMProtect or Themida (utilize their SDKs too for greater protection)
* Preform frequent integrity checks to ensure the memory of the program has not been modified
* Don't write the bytes of a file you've downloaded to disk if you don't want that file to be retrieved by the user. Rather, execute the file in memory and erase it from memory the moment execution finishes

*KeyAuth is provided in Source Code Form. The burden of client-side protection is on you the software developer, as it would be with any authentication system.*
